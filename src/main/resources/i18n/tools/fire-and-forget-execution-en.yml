description: |
  Start async execution of all registered functions without waiting for results (fire-and-forget pattern).
  Executes all pending functions that were registered using register-batch-execution.
  This tool immediately returns success status while execution continues in the background.
  Use this when you don't need to wait for execution results and want to continue with other tasks.
  Optional timer parameters allow scheduling execution for a future time. If no timer is specified, execution starts immediately.
