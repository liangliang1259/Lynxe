  Trigger the file chooser by clicking an element (e.g. "Select File" or drop zone), then set the selected file(s). Use for drag-and-drop or custom upload UI that opens a file chooser. The filePath is relative to the root plan directory. After this tool runs, you can call click-browser on the upload button (e.g. "Upload Dragged/Dropped File") if the page requires it.
